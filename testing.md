I'm testing Homu: https://github.com/barosl/homu

- Now with a separate cgwalters-bot account
- Just retrying again
- Now with branch protection on master
- Now trying to retitle issue for closing
- Change test comment link to have merge status
- New Homu version based on Servo (actually built this time)
- Tweaked some Homu patches
- Now testing status-only reporting (hopefully successfully!)
- Now after an update
- CentOS CI is starting to work
- PR testing
